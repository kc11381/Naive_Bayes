    "\n",
    "For understanding Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes, we will start with a small example and understand the end to end process. In another notebook, we will build a full-fledged email spam classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, let's take a few sentences and classify them in two different classes - education or cinema. Each sentence will represent one document. In real-world cases, a document be any piece of text such as an email, a news article, a book review, a tweet etc. The analysis and the algorithm involved doesnâ€™t depend on the type of document we use.\n",

    "The notebook is divided into the following sections:\n",
